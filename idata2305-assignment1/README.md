# Description:
Repository containing assignment 1 for the course IDATA2305

# How to run:
The code can be run directly in your IDE of choice, then you should send a HTTP request using a web browser of your choice, using the URL localhost:8080. 
The responses from the sever will be printed in the terminal in your IDE. Postman can also be used for sending HTTP requests.

# Observations made:
While working on this assignment we observed the differences between singlethreaded and multithreaded servers. 
While a singlethreaded server only handles one client/request at the time, the multithreaded server is able to take on multiple clients/requests simultaneously.
